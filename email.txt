Dear xyz@email.com,

I am writing to request a leave of absence for one week, starting tomorrow. I will be on a holiday trip during this time.

I have completed all my urgent tasks and made arrangements for my colleagues to cover my responsibilities during my absence. I will have limited access to email. 

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Himavanth
